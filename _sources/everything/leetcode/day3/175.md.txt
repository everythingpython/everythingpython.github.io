# Number 175

```{admonition} Problem Statement

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.
```

This is a simple LEFT JOIN implementation. 
The goal is to get every Person's first and last name but there is a chance that their address might not be present in the Address table. 
As such, there's a chance some entries for the state and city columns might be NULL. 

The resultant query - 

`SELECT firstName,lastName,city, state from person LEFT JOIN address ON person.personId = address.personId;`
