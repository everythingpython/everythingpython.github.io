To enable MongoDB Change Streams on your macOS system, you need to configure MongoDB as a replica set. Here's how you can set up a single-node replica set for development purposes:

**1. Configure MongoDB as a Replica Set:**

To enable replication, you'll need to modify the MongoDB configuration file:

- **Locate the Configuration File:**
    `/opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf`

- **Edit the Configuration File:**
- 
	`vim /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf`
        
- Add or modify the following lines to include replication settings:
	
	`replication:   replSetName: "rs0"`
	
	This sets the replica set name to `rs0`.

**3. Start MongoDB with the New Configuration:**

After saving the changes, start or restart the MongoDB service:

`brew services restart mongodb-community@8.0`

**4. Initialize the Replica Set:**

Once MongoDB is running with replication enabled, initiate the replica set:

- **Access the MongoDB Shell:**

  `mongosh`

- **Initiate the Replica Set:**

  `rs.initiate()`
