TIL about the importance of buildContext in Azure Devops Pipelines for a Docker@2 task. ðŸ˜µ

Kept breaking my head trying to copy files over to an image and it kept saying they weren't found. Tried a hundred combinations of paths and folder structures. 

Finally after some github-repo-hunting and documentation reading (No, LLMs didn't help) , turned out I was building a dockerfile two levels deeper from my root path and the context was set by default as the path where the Dockerfile was present. 

Once I explicitly set the buildContext, everything else fell in place. ðŸ˜ª
