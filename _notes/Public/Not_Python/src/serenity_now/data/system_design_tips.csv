System Design Tip
"Use caching (Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load."
Database sharding improves scalability by distributing data across multiple nodes.
Rate limiting prevents API abuse and ensures fair usage.
Use connection pooling to reduce the overhead of frequent DB connections.
CQRS: Separate read and write models for better scalability.
Event sourcing helps track all state changes in a system.
"Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) decouple microservices for better resilience."
Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple servers.
Failover mechanisms ensure high availability in case of failures.
Use feature flags to enable gradual rollouts of new features.
Consistent hashing helps distribute requests efficiently in distributed systems.
Design for eventual consistency in distributed databases.
Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures in microservices.
Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing of requests.
Shadow traffic testing helps detect performance issues before real deployment.
Use API gateways to centralize authentication and routing.
CDN reduces latency by caching content closer to users.
Horizontal scaling is preferred for distributed systems.
Leader election ensures a single point of authority in distributed systems.
Write-ahead logging (WAL) helps in crash recovery.
