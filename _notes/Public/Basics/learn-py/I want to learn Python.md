This is one of the most common questions I get asked by people who are just starting out with Python.

If you have no prior programming experience, how Do you start? Valid question.

Let's take it step by step.

Most guides start with understanding the syntax of Python, the basic data types, control structures etc. Which is all well and good but I think the first thing you should do is to install Python on your system.

That will be the end state of this Post i.e you will have Python installed on your system.

###  Install Python

1. Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.
