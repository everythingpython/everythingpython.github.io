# Why this topic

I was prepping for a talk about ChangeStreams and I needed to demonstrate realtime changes on my flask app and I ended up using Websockets because it was recommended on a blog. But I wanted to understand what I was using. 
I've used Websockets briefly 10 years ago to test a messaging microservice at one of my previous organizations. But time has timed since then.

# What are web sockets?

First of all, why are they called web....sockets?


# Where are they used?


# How do they differ from standard HTTP connections?



# So, why don't we use them all the time?
