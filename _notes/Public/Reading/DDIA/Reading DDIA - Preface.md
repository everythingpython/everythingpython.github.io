Over the next few weeks, I want to read a book that has been long-pending - ["Designing Data Intensive Applications"](https://www.amazon.in/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/9352135245) by Martin Kleppman. I've been building data applications for a while now but most, if not all the learnings, have been through trial and error after error after error. I've learnt a decent bit from observing more senior engineers, architects, design documents and building architectures little by little on my own, but not yet I think, in a structured, deliberate manner. I'm hoping to learn that in this book along with the other books I will likely have to refer along the way.
