## Chapter 1 - Thoughts - Cont.d 

In [[Reading DDIA - Part 1]] , I read about Reliability. The next section is Scalability . 
First let me talk about the assumptions I made about the term Scalability, what I understand from it prior to reading Martin Kleppman's thoughts on the topic - 

# What is a scalable system?


### My own thoughts prior to reading the section - 

Scale refers to how does a system grow. Growth can be needed for multiple reasons - 
- The amount of data to be processed can increase
- The number of users using the system over time can increase
- The number of users using the system at a single moment in time or certain periods of time can drastically increase. 
All of these contribute to the overall load on the system and it needs to be addressed. 
I've studied/worked with scaling of a system in two ways - horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.
