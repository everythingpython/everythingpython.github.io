Topics I intend to write about that I'm learning more about:

- Nuances of the language itself
- Its internals
- Applications using Python
- Data Science
- ML Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Databases
- Web Development
using Python. 

And this is the home for all of that.

The notes are all <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">here</a>.
