# Let's learn more about Python!

I just want to talk about all things Python language related -
- Nuances of the language itself
- Its internals
- Applications using Python
- Data Science
- ML Engineering
- Machine Learning
using Python. 

And this is the home for all of that.

The notes are all <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}">here</a>.
